## 🎨 Color Theory

The generator uses proven color harmony algorithms:

- **Complementary**: Colors opposite on the wheel (high contrast)
- **Triadic**: Three evenly spaced colors (vibrant, balanced)
- **Analogous**: Adjacent colors (harmonious, calming)
- **Split-Complementary**: Base + two adjacent to complement (softer contrast)
- **Tetradic**: Two complementary pairs (rich, diverse)

Perfect for creating game palettes that feel intentional and cohesive.
