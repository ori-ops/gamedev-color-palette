## MVP Features (Night 1)

### Core
- [ ] Color picker (HEX input + visual picker)
- [ ] Generate harmony types:
  - Complementary

  - Analogous
  - Split-complementary
  - Tetradic
- [ ] Display palette (5 colors)
- [ ] Copy to clipboard (HEX/RGB/HSL)

### Game Dev Specific

- [ ] Shareable URL with palette encoded

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Import from image (extract dominant colors)

- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Save to local storage

## Tech Stack
- Astro (static site)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- Vanilla JS (no heavy deps)

## SEO Keywords
